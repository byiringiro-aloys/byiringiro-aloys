⚡ Fun Facts About Me

🧠 ML models learn by example — they aren’t told “this is a cat,” they figure it out from thousands of cat photos.

⌛ Cybersecurity is like chess — always thinking a few moves ahead of attackers.

🔍 Debugging is like detective work — except you’re the criminal too 🕵️.

💡 The first computer bug was literally a bug — a moth stuck in a Harvard Mark II relay (1947).

🔄 Git is like time travel — except you can break the universe if you misuse rebase.

⚡ I believe every line of code should either solve a problem or teach you something new.
